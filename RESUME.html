<p>I am curious about new things, so I study hard, because reading can let me know a lot of things and increase my knowledge. I am interested in natural science and mechanical technology. I will devote myself to the scientific principles I don't understand. But sometimes I am too enthusiastic, so I often ignore the details. I will continue to improve myself and strive to become a better myself.
 <br>
  There are always unpleasant or uncontrollable things in life. For my weaknesses, I always try to stop before doing things, think twice, list the points that are good and bad for me, and then take action. Do I seek feedback from others. It helps to seek advice from people who know me. It can build my confidence and let me do more things I once thought impossible. Good teachers and friends, the more the better.

<p>Mathematics is my favorite subject in the academic year. Mathematics can solve many problems that are difficult to solve in other disciplines and exercise my thinking ability.

I also like English very much. English can broaden my knowledge. The language of many academic journals is English

Geography is also one of my favorite subjects. It allows me to understand the vast world scenery and give me a new understanding of the world
